# Horizontal privilage escelation
#### Expand  reach over the compromised system by taking over a different user who is on the same privilege level eg. normal user -> normal user.

# Vertical privilage escelation
#### Attempt to gain higher privileges or access, with an already compromised account 

# Enumeration 
## LinEnum 
#### simple bash script that performs common commands related to privilege escalation, saving time and allowing more effort to be put toward getting root.

## Adding LinEnum to target:
1. start Python web server eg. "python3 -m http.server 8000" 
2. on target use "wget" to get file from local machine
3. make file executable - "chmod +x FILENAME.sh".
